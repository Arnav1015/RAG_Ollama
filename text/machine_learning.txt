Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that \
improve automatically through experience. It is seen as a \
subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms \
build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as \
training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without \
being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms \
are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering \
and computer vision, where it is difficult or infeasible to develop \
conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks. \
Retrieval-augmented generation is a technique for enhancing the \
accuracy and reliability of generative AI models with information \
from specific and relevant data sources.\
Judges hear and decide cases based on their general understanding of the law. Sometimes a case — \
like a malpractice suit or a labor dispute requires special expertise, so judges send court clerks \
to a law library, looking for precedents and specific cases they can cite.\
The NVIDIA AI Blueprint for RAG gives developers a foundational starting point for building scalable,\
customizable retrieval pipelines that deliver both high accuracy and throughput. Use this blueprint to\
build RAG applications that provide context-aware responses by connecting LLMs to extensive\
multimodal enterprise data—including text, tables, charts, and infographics from millions of PDFs.\
With 15x faster multimodal PDF data extraction and 50% fewer incorrect answers, enterprises can\
unlock actionable insights from data and drive productivity at scale
